# Phase-two hardware qualification

The unchanged CT105 native build `70614d7`, SHA-256 `62b8190eed86cb4267447229d9ac1e8af0af0e4cdac93c67dda77204ae922623`, was exercised through the Windows XP notebook and Cisco ATA187.

## Repeated calls

Nine of ten attempts completed PPP and two public HTTP probes. Attempt `2e5a0bf5-50f3-47ec-9a70-d7f04f8f5d0d` reached DeviceConnected and failed during authentication with Windows error 718. The failure is retained; the campaign does not establish reliable cold-call startup. An initial harness cleanup issue changed that failed attempt's API status to Disconnecting, although both the notebook connection list and server session/lease state were empty. The corrected harness resumed the remaining calls without replacing the failed sample.

## Thirty-minute sustained call

Attempt `7e4c771c-d05f-456d-926d-23f885796ead` passed on one PPP connection for 1,802.317 seconds of transfer-test time:

- 224 downloads of 32 KiB: 7,340,032 verified payload bytes (7 MiB).
- 224 uploads of 1 KiB: 229,376 verified payload bytes (224 KiB).
- 45 successful public HTTP probes from the PPP address.
- Final server-side upload verification passed.
- Every expected transfer hash matched, with no failed application checks.
- Final CRC, alignment, framing, timeout and overrun counters were zero.
- Reported modem connection speed was 49,296 bit/s.
- Median download-request payload throughput was approximately 40.6 kbit/s.
- The harness disconnected and the saved final attempt is Disconnected.

Upload payloads were carried in request URLs with per-request confirmation. They prove upstream data integrity under this workload; their throughput is not a bulk upstream capacity measurement. An independent audit recomputed expected payload hashes from fixture bytes rather than trusting the harness success flag.

## Remaining gates

The 60-minute run, initial authentication-timeout investigation, controlled impairment recovery, V.34 fallback, application deployment/rollback qualification, and real simultaneous hardware calls remain incomplete. The subsequent application and routing fixes are staged separately; this result does not validate those undeployed changes. Synthetic two-hook concurrency tests do not replace simultaneous modem-call evidence.
