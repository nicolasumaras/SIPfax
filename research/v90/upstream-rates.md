# Extending the V.90 upstream receiver

The live `v90upstream.c` / `v90trellis.c` path remains restricted to 4,800 bit/s
at 3,200 symbols/s. The new `v90shell.c` component is not yet connected to that
path and does not change the advertised MP rate.

At the existing symbol clock, the first extension is 7,200 bit/s: K=6, M=2,
q=0 and eight constellation points. V.34 defines the ring ordering through its
hierarchical shell mapping. `v90shell.c` implements that ordering and its inverse,
using 64-bit counts and rejecting ring tuples outside the selected K-bit range.
See [V.34 clauses 9.2–9.6](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?id=T-REC-V.34-199802-I!!PDF-E&lang=e&type=items).

`tools/tests/v90-shell.py` independently enumerates tuples for M=1,2,3,
checks their ordering and inverse indices, and compares them with the existing
V.34 transmitter. It also tests expanded M=18/K=31 counts. The standalone
sanitizer test covers all supported M/K combinations. These checks validate
shell arithmetic, not waveform demodulation or PPP reception at a higher rate.

Remaining integration work:

- Eight-point symbol decisions and the full subset-to-trellis conversion.
- Mapping-frame alignment, ring-bit recovery and matching B1 acquisition.
- Per-rate MP generation and capability masks, followed by hardware PPP tests.

V.90 Table 16 defines upstream rate selection and its capability mask. Higher
rates must not be enabled by default until their receive path is validated.
See [V.90 Table 16](https://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?id=T-REC-V.90-199809-I!!PDF-E&lang=e&type=items).
